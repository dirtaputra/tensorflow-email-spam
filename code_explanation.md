### 1. **Import Libraries and Data**

```javascript
const tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs');
const { data, labels } = require('./data');
```

- `tf`: TensorFlow.js is the library we’re using to create and train the model.
- `data` and `labels`: We load data from another file (`data.js`). `data` contains feature values (like word frequencies in emails), and `labels` contains target results (1 for spam and 0 for not spam).

### 2. **Convert Data to Model-Readable Format**

```javascript
const trainingData = tf.tensor2d(data, [data.length, data[0].length]);
const outputData = tf.tensor2d(labels, [labels.length, 1]);
```

- TensorFlow needs the data in the form of **tensors** (like matrices in math). This line converts our data to 2D tensors (`tensor2d`), which the model can read and process.

### 3. **Build the Neural Network Model**

```javascript
const model = tf.sequential();
model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 10, activation: 'relu', inputShape: [data[0].length] }));
model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 1, activation: 'sigmoid' }));
```

- **Sequential Model**: This type of model allows us to add layers one by one.
- **First Layer**:
  - `units: 10`: This layer has 10 "neurons" to process data.
  - `activation: 'relu'`: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) adds non-linearity, helping the model capture more complex patterns.
  - `inputShape: [data[0].length]`: Sets the input shape to match the number of features in each example.
- **Second Layer**:
  - `units: 1`: Only one neuron here because we only need one output (0 or 1 for spam or not spam).
  - `activation: 'sigmoid'`: The sigmoid function gives output between 0 and 1, which works well for binary classification.

### 4. **Compile the Model**

```javascript
model.compile({
  optimizer: tf.train.adam(),
  loss: 'binaryCrossentropy',
  metrics: ['accuracy']
});
```

- **compile**: Prepares the model for training.
  - `optimizer: tf.train.adam()`: Adjusts model weights during training for better predictions. Adam is commonly used because it combines momentum and adaptive learning rates.
  - `loss: 'binaryCrossentropy'`: Measures how well or poorly the model is predicting. It’s suitable for binary classification problems.
  - `metrics: ['accuracy']`: Tracks accuracy to show how well the model is learning.

### 5. **Train the Model**

```javascript
(async function trainModel() {
  console.log('Training model...');
  await model.fit(trainingData, outputData, {
    epochs: 100,
    batchSize: 2,
    callbacks: {
      onEpochEnd: (epoch, logs) => {
        console.log(`Epoch ${epoch + 1}: loss = ${logs.loss.toFixed(4)}, accuracy = ${logs.acc.toFixed(4)}`);
      }
    }
  });
```

- **model.fit**: Here, we train the model with the given data.
  - `epochs: 100`: The model will go through the data 100 times to learn.
  - `batchSize: 2`: The model processes two examples at a time. This can help make learning more stable.
  - `callbacks`: Allows us to perform actions during training.
    - `onEpochEnd`: Called at the end of each epoch. Here, we print the loss and accuracy to monitor progress.

### 6. **Test the Model with New Data**

```javascript
  const newEmail = tf.tensor2d([[3, 0, 1]]); 
  const prediction = model.predict(newEmail);
  prediction.print();
})();
```

- **Prediction on New Data**:
  - `newEmail`: A new email to predict, represented as tensor data. For example, here the email has "promo" 3 times, "discount" 0 times, and "free" 1 time.
  - `model.predict(newEmail)`: The model predicts if this email is spam or not based on learned patterns.
  - `prediction.print()`: Outputs the prediction. A value closer to 1 indicates spam, while closer to 0 indicates not spam.

---

### Expected Outcome
- When we run the code, the model learns from the given data.
- After training, the model will predict whether a new email is spam or not, outputting a value between 0 (not spam) and 1 (spam).
